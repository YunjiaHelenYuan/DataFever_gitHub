        <h3>The etymology of data </h3>
        <br>
        <p>Do you consider data a singular or plural noun?
          According to Google, “data is...” is nearly as prevalent
          as “data are.” However, datum is the singular grammatical
          form of data. datum was first used in 1646 to indicate
          “something given.” The term describes the action of surveying
          the globe from one place to another in a geographic setting.
           Data in Chinese has a fascinating linguistic etymology similar
           to English. In Chinese, the word data 数据 stands for 数 —
           counting (verb) or number (noun), and 据 — proof or record
           for evidence. Data 数据 refers to the activity of counting
           numbers for proof of evidence.
        </p>

      <!--data selection, center text on image, sticky image-->

        <section id="sfwo">
          <figure id="ffwo">
            <p>Data stands for a collection of processed information.
              A datum can originate from anywhere, but it must always
              be translated into some form for further analysis. More
              often than not datum takes on a numerical representation.
              When a datum is registered as a data point, it loses all
              of its ambiguity and context. Only the essential value is
              kept and translated to a numerical scale.<br>
              <br>
              We should also throw light on the types of data gathered
              to develop an understanding of an issue. For the observer,
              what categories of datum are visible? The example below
              seeks to address the question, “What is boredom?” The vague
              question is reframed as to how people show boredom while
              waiting in line for coffee. The visible datum for the
              observer is people’s movements. And by counting and
              categorizing specific behaviours, we conclude that a
              particular action signals that the person is bored. We
              rely on indirect data to construct a sophisticated grasp
              of a subject. If a datum is not visible to the observer,
              it will never be included in the dataset. </p>

              These are subjective judgements defined by us, rendering
              the data fetched biased from the outset. The 2018’s “gender
              shades” project study reveals divergent facial recognition

        <h3>What is good data?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>To keep its vibrancy, data is constantly updated. As a result,
          it is necessary to maintain, alter, and optimize the dataset.
          A study of something is always provided with interest. A regular
          data cleaning guarantees an accurate interpretation of the data
          pattern. The dirty data is the inconsistent, imprecise, erroneous,
          and outdated bits. What remains in the dataset presents itself
          as a neutral, objective entity. It must be selected, filtered,
          and synthesized for any datum to be used. <br>
          <br>
          A data point involves someone somehow counting, deciding what to
          keep and what to remove, and utilizing the dataset to develop a
          knowledge of a subject of interest. Data is the pinnacle of a
          system that makes sense of, manages, and controls a subject.
          Data is essential to the operation of any hierarchical administration.
          As Lisa Gitelman argued in Paper Knowledge, “Any object can
          be a thing, but once it is framed as or entered into evidence —
          once it is mobilized — it becomes a document, an instance
          proper to that genre.” To exist and function as data,
          it must be framed and presented as such. Data entails the process
          of counting, collecting, and interpreting.

            <p>Technological advancements have strengthened our assumption
            that data is digital, invisible, and intangible. With cloud
            computing, submarine cable connections, and server farms,
            data disappears right in front of us and regenerates itself
            in a digital representation while lives on some hard drives
            in a data centre thousands of miles away.The contemporary
            era of big data allows datasets to grow beyond our imagination
            and capacity to grasp its scale. The sheer physical volume of
            one of Google’s datasets, for example, is nearly impossible
            to visualize.

        <p>In her book Raw Data Is an Oxymoron, Lisa Gitelman asks,
          “What are we to data and data to us?”
          More often than not, we are the source of data.
          "Data is the new oil." said by Clive Humby in 2006. 4 years after
          Humby’s statement, Schneier provokes the increasingly
          prevalent idea that if we are the producer of data, we are,
          in turn, the product of data. Everything about us, from
          where we live to what we consume, is a fruitful data point.

        <h4>Ephemeral Realism, Eternal Reverie</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
           Can data be forgotten? Does data die? Data Fever is an
           experimental project that aims to disrupt the normality
           ties around data. Data has been held as a neutral,
           intangible perpetual entity which seems to be immune
           to the power of time. Through research, writing, and
           making, Data Fever sets out to destabilize the assumption
           and give form to data’s subjectivity, materiality, and
           ephemerality. Data Fever wishes to provoke questions
           and creates space for conversations.

            <p>DataFever.digital & DataFever.pdf encapsulates the
              full breadth of thesis research and design process.
              .digital is a temporary site that adapts Data Fever's
              content into an interactive experience, resulting in
              a wider data circulation. .pdf uses bindery.js to create a ready-to-print
              file inscribing all content into the printed matter
              for more transparent data access and longer data storage.
              DataFever.digital & DataFever.pdf sheds light on the
              transitory nature of the internet, the fragility of
               media and the limitation of the digital and printed matters.
              The project serves both as a platform to host all
              creative practices and also as a design artifact for
              further discussion.

              .digital & .pdf presents a mode of
              practice traversing between the digital and the analogue.
              DataFever.digital emphasizes the physicality of the
              digital data and the fleeting nature of the internet,
              while DataFever.pdf offers an alternative approach to
              preserving the digital, bringing the two formats closer.
              The project is an very first step to blend the digital and the analogue.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I've always had trouble thinking about design in terms like
          neutrality, utility, and standard. These do not set well with
          me, and I find myself wondering: what are the limitations of
          design, and what is the role of a designer?<br>
          <br>
          I meant to approach the concept of the norm at the start of the
          thesis, but I battled for months to find the suitable language
          or content to convey my concept. As my research progressed, it
          became clear to me that the task was to develop a language and
          forms for the notions. The issue with normalcy is that it is
          ubiquitous, and it is difficult to initiate a dialogue without
          a form and language.<br>
          <br>
          The thesis then became more experimental as I employed tools that I enjoy,
          tools that I am afraid of, and tools that I had never used before. I
          recognized how to counteracting the force of normality by accentuating,
          zooming in, and forging. The majority of emphasis is placed on analogue
          media. In retrospect, I'm curious how the project would have progressed
          if a more digital approach had been employed. <br>
          <br>
          It’s the first step of my design inquiry and pointing me keep learning
          and questioning. This project has allowed me to immerse myself in the
          unknown, to become lost while allowing my curiosity to be the driving force.
